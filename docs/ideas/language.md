AFAIK, the current NLP focus on how machine could understand human language.
However, from a learning perspective, it's not giving machine an opportunity to
learn stuff. Machine never has the momentum to learn, to write. It's passive.
This contradicts with how human learns. For human, language is mostly used for
collaboration. However, in early time, there's not much need for collaboration.
Our two main targets in lives are food and reproduction. Without language, one
can still live well, but for reproduction, it would be hard. In some case, if
you are mature and ready, you might want to send out signals to people near you
so that they know you are ready. And if some other's are ready, they would come
and reproduce with you. Otherwise, you might die without a successful offspring.

And we have some instinct to tell if a sound means scary, happy, or sad. That's
useful in our collaboration. Scary sound can inform family or friends to stay
alert, etc.
