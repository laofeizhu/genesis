One possible achievement of this project is knowledge generator.

Agents/robots in my virual world will be able to learn, think, and write.

For example, if they are taught language, we could possibly put them in some
environment so that they will be writing poems, novels, or even literatures in
the form that we've never seen.

Maybe they could also learn painting, architecture (in MineCraft) etc.

Or maybe we provide physics facts in the world and they could come with new
hypotheses, theory etc. They could do better than us because they could think
faster than us. Maybe we are just a knowledge generator that god created and we
could think faster than god (god is a tree?). Maybe one day, the robots we
created will be able to find something faster in their world and create their
knowledge generator.
